This program sends arbitrary RFID codes (normal manchester
coding).  Pin 5 should be connected to base of NPN transistor
through 5k resistor, with 125kHz parallel LC circuit connected
between base and emitter of transistor.  For initial testing, 
you can just use a coil of wire without worrying about making
it resonant, but best range will be achieved by placing a 
capacitor in parallel with a value chosen to achieve resonance
near 125kHz.

I verified operation with the Sparkfun RFID reader.
