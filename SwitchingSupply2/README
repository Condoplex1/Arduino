This is a switching voltage booster.  It provides a regulated voltage output.  

Some external circuitry is required.  The outPin must be connected to the
gate of a switching transistor, such as the IRF510.  The Source is connected
to ground, and the drain is connected through an inductor (value is not 
critical - I used 180 uH) to the positive supply.  The drain is also connected
to a diode rated for the expected voltage.  A small capacitor (good for the 
expected voltage) is connected between the other side of the diode and ground.
This is where the output voltage is produced.  Connect two resistors across 
the output to form a voltage divider, and connect the center of the divider 
to inPin.  

The Arduino will adjust the pulse width of the pulses into the FET so as to 
maintain 1 volt at inPin.  So if, for example, you use 22k and 1k for the 
voltage divider, you should see 23 volts on the output.  As a larger load is
applied, the microcontroller will increase the pulse width to maintain the
output at the same voltage level.  

If you have an LCD, connect it to the Arduino to get information about the
currently measured voltage at the inPin, as well as the present pulse width.
An LCD is not absolutely necessary for operation, but may be useful for 
debugging purposes to get the circuit working initially.

I have successfully used this circuit to power a neon lamp, using a divider
composed of 10k and 1Meg resistors.  Be sure your resistors in the voltage
divider can handle the necessary power.
